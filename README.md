A program that allows you to write text but bigger, it doesn't also work very well but it's acceptable.

Here's a list of all the characters:
- All of the alphabet (A-Z)
- Comma (,)
- Point (.)
- Space ( )
- Numbers (0-9)

I'm also going to include more if I decide to update the program, maybe I could add something like lowercase letters or other symbols.
